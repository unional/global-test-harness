Starts a `jsdom` instance and load global namespace code similar to module code for testing.

## Usage

See [`src/index.spec.ts`](src/index.spec.ts)

Also, the file structure should match the namespace stucture, and each file should declares only one component.
e.g. `mycompany/product/SomeComponent.js` declares `MyCompany.product.SomeComponent`.

If your code deviate from it, you can still use this library but you need to do this to get your component:

```ts
await harness.import('./relative/path/to/your/file')
const yourComponent = harness.get('YourCompany.yourProduct.yourComponent')
```

Note that this library does not resolve your global namespace reference magically.
You need to load your files in the right order to run the test.

## Contribute

```sh
# right after clone
npm install

# begin making changes
git checkout -b <branch>
npm run watch

# edit `webpack.config.es5.js` and `rollup.config.es2015.js` to exclude dependencies for the bundle if needed

# after making change(s)
git commit -m "<commit message>"
git push

# create PR
```

## Npm Commands

There are a few useful commands you can use during development.

```sh
# Run tests (and lint) automatically whenever you save a file.
npm run watch

# Run tests with coverage stats (but won't fail you if coverage does not meet criteria)
npm run test

# Manually verify the project.
# This will be ran during 'npm preversion' so you normally don't need to run this yourself.
npm run verify

# Build the project.
# You normally don't need to do this.
npm run build

# Run tslint
# You normally don't need to do this as `npm run watch` and `npm version` will automatically run lint for you.
npm run lint
```
